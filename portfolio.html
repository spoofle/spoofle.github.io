            <p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong></i>Default Rate Prediction</strong>: Project done for Bitcamp 2024. Uses three input variables - weather data, interest rate, and employment rate - and predicts the default rate. Utilizes LSTMs and data augmentation using Gen AI to measure and increase accuracy of predictions. Written in Python.</li>
                <li><strong>Recall Pit</strong>: An app available on both iOS and Android that pulls recalled items announced by the FDA/CPSC/USDA and compiles them into an accessible and easily readable format. Built using Flutter/Dart and hosted database backend on Google Cloud.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are accessible through my Github!</p>
